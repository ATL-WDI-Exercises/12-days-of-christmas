# The Twelve Days of Christmas

Write a program that prints out the lyrics to the *Twelve Days of Christmas*.
Your solution should use arrays and loops to minimize the amount of code and keep things DRY.

## Bonus

Print out how many total gifts were sent. For example, on day 1 there is 1 gift sent (a partridge) and on day 2 there are 2 gifts sent (two turtle doves and a partridge).
